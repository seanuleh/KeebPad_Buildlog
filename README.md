# KeebPad Build Log

## Summary

This project is not solving any fundamental issue or creating something that does not exist. This project's sole purpose is to help me explore the world of microcontrollers (namely, the ESP32). It is also a way to learn PCB Design and introduction to the world of mechanical keyboards.

The goal is to create a Bluetooth Macropad with mechanical switches. Ideally, the final product will have a custom PCB with RGB LED backlighting, hotswappable sockets, OLED display and some menu/configuration interaction mechanism directly on the product, such as a rotary encoder or joystick
