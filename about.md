This is an attempt to dump the knowledge I gather during the process of building a Bluetooth Macropad on the ESP32.

The goal is to build a BLE Macropad using Mechanical Keyboard Switches. I would like the device to be battery powered and have an OLED display for user interactions via either a joystick or rotary encoder.

Component specific articles are found on the homepage. These will be updated and include information about specific parts of the build.

Check the top navigation bar to find blog posts. These will document my progress through the project and once created should not be updated.
